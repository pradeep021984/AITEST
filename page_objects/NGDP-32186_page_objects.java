*****************

**Page Object Code**:

```java
//This is a skeleton, needs implementation based on your app's structure and testing framework.

public class AppHomePage {

    //Locators for elements related to app version and Kochava SDK version info (e.g., from a settings page)
    //Example:
    //private By appVersionLocator = By.id("appVersion");
    //private By kochavaSDKVersionLocator = By.id("kochavaSDKVersion");

    //Method to retrieve app version
    public String getAppVersion(){
        //return driver.findElement(appVersionLocator).getText();
        return "Implementation Needed";
    }

    //Method to retrieve Kochava SDK version
    public String getKochavaSDKVersion(){
        //return driver.findElement(kochavaSDKVersionLocator).getText();
        return "Implementation Needed";
    }

    //Method for updating the SDK (this would likely involve more complex interactions, potentially using external tools or APIs)
    public void updateKochavaSDK(String version) {
        //Implementation to update Kochava SDK to the specified version.
        //This might involve using a package manager or a specific update mechanism within your app.
    }

}
```

Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual implementation details based on your application's architecture and testing framework (e.g., Selenium, Appium).  The `getKochavaSDKVersion` method in both the Step Definition and Page Object will require significant effort to accurately retrieve the SDK version.  You may need to use reflection, access manifest files, or other methods depending on your app's structure.  The multi-version scenario also needs a robust implementation to handle multiple app versions.

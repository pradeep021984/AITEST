Feature: Group Order Menu Access for Guest User

  Scenario: Guest User Accesses Group Order Menu
    Given the user is on the Group Member Landing page
    When the user provides their name and clicks the "Join Group Order" button
    Then the user is redirected to the Category Landing Page
    And the page title is "Marketing Meeting’s Group Order"
    And the page contains a "Hamburger" button
    And the page contains a Cart icon
    And the page displays "Pickup at “Location”" with an icon
    And the page displays "ASAP" or a scheduled time with an icon (as proposed by the host)
    And the page displays the order by date and time (e.g., "Order By MM/DD/YY X:XXpm") in red if the member exceeds the timeframe
    And the page displays the order limit (e.g., "Order Limit $xx") if applicable
    And the page contains a brand-specific Search Menu field
    And the page displays brand-specific Allergens & Sensitivities options
    And the page displays "Menu", "Recents", and "Favourites" tabs
    And the page displays a list of categories
    And the page displays all attributes with copy, size, and styling as per the Figma design [https://www.figma.com/design/tJzJy7WVGqRyrm85talrk0/MOE-APP-SP3-UI?node-id=105-57269&t=fxxZPUFtN1uffrPH-4]

```

**Notes:**

* The Gherkin scenario directly reflects the acceptance criteria.  Each "And" step corresponds to a specific requirement.
* The Figma link is included for reference in the feature file.  This is good practice for traceability.
*  The scenario assumes the "Order By" date and time, and Order Limit are handled conditionally (if applicable).  More detailed scenarios might be needed to cover the variations of these fields being present or absent.
*  This feature file focuses on the happy path.  Additional scenarios would be needed to cover error handling (e.g., invalid name input, network errors).  Consider adding scenarios for edge cases (e.g.,  no order limit,  order deadline passed).
*  The "Hamburger" button and Cart icon are treated as textual descriptions for simplicity.  In a more robust BDD approach, these might be identified via selectors or other locators for automation purposes.  Similarly, more detailed checks on styling and sizing might require additional steps or even separate scenarios focused on visual verification (potentially outside of Gherkin and using visual testing tools).


This improved feature file provides a clearer and more comprehensive representation of the user story's requirements for automated testing using a BDD framework.
